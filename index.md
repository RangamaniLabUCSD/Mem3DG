Mem3DG is a flexible software package to model the membrane and its dynamics using unstructured meshes.
This work is currently under heavy development, please star this repository to follow along!

## Acknowledging your use of Mem3DG

Mem3DG is developed by [Cuncheng Zhu](https://github.com/cuzhucuncheng), [Christopher T. Lee](https://ctlee.github.io/), with contributions from others.
Development of Mem3DG is funded in part by AFOSR MURI FA9550-18-1-0051, and a Hartwell Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship.

## Dependencies

* Meshes are represented using [Geometry-Central](https://geometry-central.net/).
* Optional trajectory output uses [NetCDF-cxx4](https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-cxx4).

### Visualization
* Optional trajectory visualization in Python uses [Polyscope](https://polyscope.run/py/).
* Optional trajectory reading in Python uses [NetCDF4-python](https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf4-python).
