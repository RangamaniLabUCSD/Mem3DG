In previous tutorials, we only simulate closed membrane and therefore no addditional complexity on the boundary. Though in reality, lipid membrane is almost always closed, it is beneficial to only simulate certain region of the membrane to save computational cost. \n",

One notable difference between close mesh and open mesh is the reference area, which will remain as long as boundary position is fixed (a.k.a fixed and pin boundary). Additional reference mesh may be needed when doing roller boundary condition when for example, continuing an interrupted simulation. \n"

This is particularly true when membrane reservoir is so large that local deformation is too unnoticeable that approximately it is just applying some constant value of pressure and tension. To do this explicitly, you can replace the functional forms of the tension and osmotic pressure calculation. Helper functions are provided in the boilerplates."
